pip install Django —— This command is used to tell pip to install a certain package

pip list —— This will return a list of installed packages, including editables. The Packages are listed in case-insensitive sorted order.

pip install Django —— After I gave this command the second time, I received the following message:

Requirement already satisfied: Django in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from Django)

which is telling me that I already installed Django

pip freeze —— This outputs installed packages in requirement format.  The main difference between the two is that freeze gives us the standard requirement format that may be used with pip install -r to install requirements. Pip list just lists.

First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file? ——— I see a file on the desktop, requirements.txt.  Inside the file it’s what pip freeze outputs, just put into a file.

pip uninstall Django ——— uninstalls Django from the computer

pip show Django ——— This shows information about the installed packages, in this case Django

pip search Flask - this searches for PyPI packages whose names or summary contains the package at hand.
